Will learn : How to choose between different ML algorithms along with various hyper parameter tuning. 

## Steps :
1. Open *dataset* folder and download titanic.csv dataset. This is also available in Kaggle.
2. Follow the below file order in *modelling* folder
  - Data Preprocessing (output is generated in *dataset* folder)
  - Split data (output is generated in *dataset* folder)
  - SVM - Support Vector Model (output is generated in *models* folder)
  - RF - Random Forest model (output is generated in *models* folder)
  - Gredient Boosting Model (output is generated in *models* folder)
  - Final model selection and evaluation
3. Now you can select the best machine learning model as per *Final model selection and evaluation* result 

Note: we have exported the best estimated hyperparameter model as pickle to reuse them.
